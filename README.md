# COVID19_Symptom_Analysis

Individual project from course "Data Science and Analytics". The goal of this project is to use NLP and other machine learning algorithms to develop a tool that can text-mine this database of research articles to gain useful insights about COVID-19 and how we might be able to tackle the outbreak, contain the spread and flatten the curve.
